CleanZip is now installed!

Currently, right click functionality is only supported on Windows, but the jar can still be run via the 
command line and passed the file location as a parameter.

To use, right click on a file and select "Zip/UnZip with CleanZip" or "java -jar Path/to/CleanZip.jar file/to/un.zip"

Currently, only .zip files are supported.

Happy Zipping!
